Music-ChordBot

Chordbot is a songwriting tool / electronic backup band for
iPhone/iPad and Android that lets you experiment with advanced chord
progressions and arrangements quickly and easily. You can use Chordbot
for songwriting experiments, as accompaniment when learning new songs
or for making backing tracks for your guitar / saxophone / theremin
solos.

ChordBot can import and export songs in JSON format. Music::ChordBot
provides a set of modules that can be used to programmatically
build songs and produce the JSON data suitable for import into
ChordBot.

Note that Music::ChordBot requires the full version of ChordBot since
the Lite version does not have import capabilities.
